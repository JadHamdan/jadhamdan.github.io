                    I'm currently a first year Mathematics DPhil student at <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk">Oxford University</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research interests lie in probability theory and its applications to number theory and computer science, currently focusing on random matrix theory.
                    Prior to my DPhil, I worked in density estimation and random variate generation under 
                    <a href="http://luc.devroye.org">Prof. Luc Devroye</a>. Before that, I studied <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03195">random trees</a> under <a href="http://problab.ca/louigi/">Prof. Louigi Addario-Berry</a> and friends.
                </p>
                <p> For a list of publications and preprints, see my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kIWrLA0AAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>.</p>
                <p>
                    I've had the honour and privilege of working with many student organizations during few
                    years at McGill. My favourite of these experiences was being one of the <a href="https://www.mcgillai.com/mais202">McGill AI Society's</a> two
                    academic lecturers during the Fall 2020 and Winter 2021 semesters. This gave me the opportunity to develop 
                    and co-teach an introductory machine learning course to undergraduate students, for which I co-wrote a textbook.
                </p>
        
                <p> When I'm not studying, you'll find me reading or pursuing other passions such as cooking and playing the piano.
                    My favourite composers are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JaY0IZEy90&t=760s">Rachmaninoff</a> 
                    (whose handspan plagues both my friend <a href="https://abrandenberger.github.io" href>Anna</a> and I) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTYUyDjVCRU">Ravel</a>.
